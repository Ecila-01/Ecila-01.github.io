                <h1> MANGA / MANHUA / MANHWA </h1>
                <p> These 3 are the equivalent of comics in the West. The difference between them is that Manga came from Japan, Manhwa came from Korea and Manhua came from China. Here, I'll be giving you recommendations for some of my favorites. I've included mix genres that are worth checking out!</p>

                                <p>Koito Yuu just began her first year in high school but still hesitates to respond to a confession she received from her friend during middle school graduation. Unlike the sparkly and bright love she hears in music and reads in books, his confession did not fill her heart with any emotion.
                                <br><br>
                                As Yuu walks to the student council, she stumbles upon Nanami Touko turning down a confession with certainty and kindness. Nanami's confident response that she has no intention of dating anyone sparked Yuu's interest, so she seeks Nanami's advice on how to respond to her own confession. Yuu confides that she already decided to turn him down, explaining how she wanted to fall in love but is unable to as she has never felt what it is like to have someone special.
                                <br><br>
                                Nanami comforts Yuu with sympathy for the difficulty of wanting to love but not having someone to fall in love with, and at that moment Yuu's phone rings. Nanami takes Yuu's hand and tells her she only needs to speak from her heart. As Yuu turns down his confession, Nanami's hand still holding hers, a bright new spark was formed</p><br>

                                <p>A good Girl's Love (GL) series and highly recommended for GL beginners and even non-gl fans. Good romance story and great art. One of the best GL I've ever read and has an anime adaptation too. Its anime adaptation is the most popular GL anime as of now.</p>

                                <p>Sixteen-year-old Ai Hoshino is a talented and beautiful idol who is adored by her fans. She is the personification of a pure, young maiden. But all that glitters is not gold.
                                <br><br>
                                Gorou Amemiya is a countryside gynecologist and a big fan of Ai. So when the pregnant idol shows up at his hospital, he is beyond bewildered. Gorou promises her a safe delivery. Little does he know, an encounter with a mysterious figure would result in his untimely death—or so he thought.
                                <br><br>  
                                Opening his eyes in the lap of his beloved idol, Gorou finds that he has been reborn as Aquamarine Hoshino—Ai's newborn son! With his world turned upside down, Gorou soon learns that the world of showbiz is paved with thorns, where talent does not always beget success. Will he manage to protect Ai's smile that he loves so much with the help of an eccentric and unexpected ally?</p><br>
                                <h3> Review: </h3>
                                <p>A good lesson on how the idol industry or the business industry as whole works in Japan, although this is fiction, this series reflects the industry well. The dark side shows the problem they are facing and how hard it is to survive in the said industry. Everything is great from art to plot.</p>

                                Confused and surprised, Yori asks her friends for consultation, but they tease her by saying that she is experiencing love.

                                <p>A pure and wholesome romance. Reading this the first time, I couldn't help blushing and smiling like an idiot. Fruity and wholesome romance between a first-year and her senior. At some point, I even stopped reading this because I don't want to read it only for it to end in a cliffhanger</p>

                                <p>Among the seaside town of Izu's ocean waves and rays of shining sun, Iori Kitahara is just beginning his freshman year at Izu University. As he moves into his uncle's scuba diving shop, Grand Blue, he eagerly anticipates his dream college life, filled with beautiful girls and good friends.
                                <br><br>
                                But things don't exactly go according to plan. Upon entering the shop, he encounters a group of rowdy, naked upperclassmen, who immediately coerce him into participating in their alcoholic activities. Though unwilling at first, Iori quickly gives in and becomes the heart and soul of the party. Unfortunately, this earns him the scorn of his cousin, Chisa Kotegawa, who walks in at precisely the wrong time. Undeterred, Iori still vows to realize his ideal college life, but will things go according to plan this time, or will his situation take yet another dive?</p><br>

                                <p>Probably the most hilarious manga I've read. It may be a manga about diving but the content is more like 10% diving and 90% comedy scene. The jokes are gold and honestly, there's not a single comedy scene here that I didn't laugh at.</p>

                                <p>My favorite manhwa, It is also my very first. It's an isekai series done right. A good royal fantasy manhwa and a very wholesome story between a daughter and his father. Due to this being my first, my standards on manhwa became very high and I rarely read one who's not as good or at least close to this. </p>

                                <h3> Review: </h3>
                                <p>In this series, you'll love everyone. I like how the author keeps on trolling the readers but despite that, they managed to create a story that everyone loves. It also received an anime adaptation and currently sitting at the top. It's a romantic comedy where both the romance and the comedy are 10/10 which is rare. Along with the characters, art, and plot, this series is a masterpiece.</p>

                                <h3> Review: </h3>
                                <p>Despite it being a story of their facades, it's still a wholesome series where one can see that their family's relationships are no longer just a facade but rather, their true selves. A wholesome, cute and funny series but with occasional action mixed in.</p>

                                <h3> Review: </h3>
                                <p>Our protagonist is just a weak kid trying to survive but at one point, his life turns around, and will grow into an amazing person. You will witness his growth throughout the series and at some point, you'll get attached to him and all his friends. The series starts off slow and boring but once you get past that, you'll find yourself wanting more.</p>

                                <p>Kou Yamori seems like a typical middle school student on the surface. Relatively good at studies and amiable with his classmates, he puts a lot of effort into maintaining this facade. One day, however, he decides to stop pretending and quits school, developing insomnia as a result of having no daytime outlet for his energy. When taking walks alone at night, he feels marginally better, though he is aware that his inability to sleep should be considered a serious problem.
                                <br><br>
                                On one such walk, Kou meets Nazuna Nanakusa, a weird girl who diagnoses the cause of his sleeplessness: despite making changes in his life, he is still holding himself back from experiencing true freedom. She says that he won't be able to sleep unless he is satisfied with how he spends his waking hours. When it appears that she has resolved his current worries, Nazuna invites him back to her apartment to share her futon. After a while, unaware that he is only feigning unconsciousness, she leans over him—and bites his neck</p><br>

                                <p>It's a series everyone relates to: being a night owl. A mix of supernatural and slice-of-life elements, it's kind of refreshing. The romance is also cute and the art and sceneries are breathtaking.</p>

                                <p>Engrossed in the family business of traditional doll making, Wakana Gojou is a reserved high school freshman without friends. Harboring painful memories of a childhood friend's disdain toward his interest, Gojou cannot relate to his classmates and their pastimes, eventually isolating himself.
                                <br><br>
                                Gojou has yet to perfect his crafting of dolls' faces, but is exceptionally skilled at making their clothes. His finesse with the sewing machine is soon discovered by his beautiful classmate Marin Kitagawa, whose boldness and honesty Gojou both admires and envies. Instantly, she shares with Gojou her own hobby: she likes to cosplay as characters from erotic video games.
                                <br><br>
                                However, Kitagawa cannot sew her own costumes, leading her to seek Gojou's expertise. Now, as he is dragged along to the charming girl's endless cosplay-related affairs, Kitagawa becomes his first friend who fully accepts him. Thus, although polar opposites, their relationship slowly blossoms through their aptitude in helping each other in the intricate world of cosplay.

                                <h3> Review: </h3>
                                <p>Although famous for being full of fanservices, I still think  if you look past that, you'll see a great series. You'll see a character enjoying his own hobby and working hard for it. The art is also pretty and the story are entertaining despite it being a slice of life. You'll also see a short background on the cosplay industry and it's kind of educational.</p>

In his opinion, real life is an awful game; three-dimensional girls are annoying and false representations of how a real girl should be.
                                <br><br>
                                One afternoon, while taking a break from cleaning duty, he stumbles across a strange message that goads him to conquer a girl. On a whim, he accepts, and his consent summons a girl named Elucia "Elsie" de Lute Ima, a denizen of hell tasked with capturing runaway spirits that have festered in girls' hearts. Keima is shocked and tries to escape, but Elsie tells him that failure in fulfilling the newly-formed contract will result in the termination of his life!

                                <p>I remember reading this and thought to myself how hilarious the concept was. But honestly, it's a good series once it gets serious. I also enjoyed how the protagonist never shows interest despite all the cute girls around him. This series also made me try giving visual novel games a try which I enjoyed playing.</p>
