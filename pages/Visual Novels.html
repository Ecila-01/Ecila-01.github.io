                                <h2 id = "title">The Sci;Adv Series</h2>
                                <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                                <p>Science Adventure is a series of visual novels planned by Chiyomaru Shikura and developed by 5pb. Games and MAGES., occasionally in collaboration with Nitroplus. The series, which began with Chaos;Head NoAH in 2009, spans seven main visual novel entries and several side visual novel entries. The series also consists of other material, such as anime adaptations, light novels, and manga
                                <br><br>
                                Each entry in the Science Adventure Series is part of a continuous, interconnected narrative. This means that the events of one title may be referenced in another, or even affect the other title's events in their entirety. In the same way, a single character may appear in more than one of the entries, either physically or by other means.
                                <br><br>
                                At their cores, the titles of the series utilize science, conspiracy, and mystery as their main themes. In some cases (particularly in the Chaos; titles), thriller is also a primary theme. It is also worth mentioning that while some entries in the series are relatively light in terms of their imagery, Chaos;Head and Chaos;Child sometimes feature heavy depictions of gore.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3> Review: </h3>
                                <p>While Steins;Gate, its 2nd entry was a hit, every entry on this series is as great, if not, better. It's highly recommended for those who love science. If you enjoyed the Steins;Gate anime, you'll enjoy its vn and the series as a whole.</p>

                                <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                                <p>Summer Pockets is set on an isolated, rural and peaceful island on the Seto Inland Sea called Torishirojima, which has a population of about 2,000 people. The protagonist is Hairi Takahara, a young man not native to the island. Hairi grew up in an urban setting, but after an unpleasant incident he uses the recent death of his grandmother as an excuse to come to the island to take care of her estate sale. Once there, he gets to know four girls who are the focus of the story. They include Shiroha Naruse, who forgot her summer vacation; Ao Sorakado, who is pursuing the legends of the island; Kamome Kushima, a high-class girl looking for a pirate ship; and Tsumugi Wenders, a younger girl trying to find herself.

                                <p>Another series from my favorite studio, Key.  While not as good as their older series, it's still a great read and I recommend it for beginners. The series still follow the old pattern of starting with goofy and funny scenes to making us cry in the last chapter. I love how this still never changes. I'm looking forward to their next work. </p>

                                <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                                <p>In a world where flying through the sky is as simple as riding a bicycle, the sport "Flying Circus" is all the rage.
                                <br><br>
                                Following the discovery of anti-gravitons, special shoes that allow an individual to fly, Anti-Graviton Shoes, took the world by storm.
                                <br><br>
                                And with the Grav Shoes came an entire new world for people to explore. Not long after, that revolution in technology gave birth to a brand new sport, Flying Circus, which used the shoes to make players compete in the open sky.
                                <br><br>
                                Hinata Masaya, who was once considered a prodigy, turned his back on Flying Circus after suffering a crushing defeat, although there was also another reason...
                                <br><br>
                                However, his former passion is reignited while teaching the new transfer student, Kurashina Asuka, how to fly.
                                <br><br>
                                This time, Masaya chooses to enter the world of Flying Circus not as a player, but a coach. Sometimes fighting, and at other times encouraging each other, he and his team decide to challenge the top student athletes in Japan.
                                <br><br>
                                Now, with Asuka by his side, how high will he be able to fly?
                                <br><br>
                                This is a love story about those who met through the sky, as well as the friends who surround them.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3> Review: </h3>
                                <p>A mix of romance and sport, a rare and interesting combination of genres. Albeit a fictional sport, you'll feel the hype in each game. This visual novel is one of the top series to recommend to beginners and I, too, highly recommend it.</p>

                                <p>Life is like a staircase. You just gotta keep climbing. Otherwise, if you start to overthink it, you'll have trouble taking the next step.
                                <br><br>
                                Shinichi wants nothing more than to lead a quiet life. Though he was once close friends with Miyuki, the most popular girl in school, his desire for normalcy now keeps them from being anything more than classmates.
                                <br><br>
                                Everything changes, however, one day on the roof, when the class oddball, Aoi, suddenly tries to kiss him. Miyuki appears just in time to stop her, but afterward, Shinichi feels the urge to bring some light to this friendless girl's eyes. He enlists Miyuki's aid, and thus, a trio is born.
                                <br><br>
                                The days pass, and little by little, Aoi learns what it means to be friends. But at the same time, long-dormant feelings awaken in Miyuki's heart. As the distance between her and Shinichi shrinks, the hard-earned bonds the three share begin to fray.
                                <br><br>
                                Miyuki or Aoi－when the time comes, who will Shinichi choose?

                                <h3> Review: </h3>
                                <p>A really creepy game but still fun to play nonetheless. It's a series that breaks 4th flag and it gives me the creeps whenever they break it. Creepiness is not just its only charm as it contains a great story with 2 loveable characters</p>

                                <p>Start off really cute but what could go wrong? I love how this series is full of interesting easter eggs in-game and even outside the game. Better to play it blind without looking at walkthroughs and such. - Just Monika</p>

                                <p>Rewrite is set in the fictional city Kazamatsuri where treeplanting and afforestation have caused the city to become overgrown with trees and flowers in much the same way that other cities are filled by buildings. However, while most of the city appears to be rural, there are many traditional city elements as well. While set in a modern setting, the city also gives off a strange sense of nostalgia.
                                <br><br>
                                Tennouji Kotarou lives here. He's a high school student who has the ability to rewrite his own body; he can become stronger and faster at any time he chooses. He investigates supernatural mysteries with five girls from his school.

                                <p>Rewrite is another game from Studio Key but it's like their step outside of their comfort zone. They tried new things with this game and it's a success. One could even say that this is their best game and I can agree with them. It has an anime adaptation that doesn't do it any justice and I would recommend skipping it and just go play the game.</p>

                                <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                                <p>Hope's Peak Academy is a government-funded private high school recognized all across the nation as the cradle of hope and prosperity, providing a complete education for "ultimate" students of all stripes.
                                <br><br>
                                Thanks to a national lottery, one extremely lucky but otherwise ordinary student—Makoto Naegi—has been chosen to attend this prestigious institution.
                                <br><br>
                                But when Makoto arrives for his first day of class, he suddenly falls unconscious, and when he wakes up he finds himself in a classroom within the school—with the windows barred and the doors locked. As he explores the abandoned, dirty halls, it becomes clear that something is very wrong. He and his new classmates make their way to the gymnasium, where a demented robotic bear, calling himself Monokuma and claiming to be the school's headmaster, makes a declaration: "You're all going to be living here from now on. If you want to go free, your only choice... is murder."
                                <br><br>
                                And so... fifteen high school students gathered from across the country have been imprisoned. Their strength, their commitment, their very humanity will be tested time and time again. Why must they clash in these class trials? Who's the mastermind behind it all? And what is this shadowy figure really after? The battle against the looming, invisible enemy known only as despair is about to begin...

                                <p>A murder-mystery killing game. A story where we need to survive and pass each trial or else it's game over. I like how this was supposed to be a murder mystery but the game mascot is trolling us each time he appears in-game. My first visual novel which got me hooked and also one of the series I highly recommend for beginners.</p>

                                <p>It's a series where we need to reach the happy ending but how hard could it be when the character is so needy? We need to make sure that she's getting enough love, allocating enough time for work, touching some grass, and having a good internet persona while also making her a success. Well, it's a game about a needy girlfriend so.....  </p>

                                <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                                <p>Subarashiki Hibi is a story told in seven chapters. The story follows a group of several Tokyo high school students mostly through July of 2012 and each chapter is told from the perspective of one of its five main characters. Because of the same timeframe coverage, certain events are overlapping from chapter to chapter but at the core of it all is a mystery revolving around the prophecy about the end of the world on July the 20th as well as the events that are following before the said date. The first part of the VN is used to make a setting for the said mysteries while the second part is about uncovering the truth behind them all.
                                <br><br>
                                The story begins in chapter #1, 'Down the Rabbit-Hole I" on July 12, 2012. The protagonist, Minakami Yuki, lives a peaceful everyday life with Tsukasa and Kagami, her childhood friends, when one day she meets a mysterious girl, Takashima Zakuro (a girl in another class in Yuki's school, who seems to have met Yuki before but Yuki doesn't remember her). The strange schoolmate Yuki just befriended moves into her house (Yuki doesn't mind too much about that). Then following this new guest in Minakami's residence, Yuki's two childhood friends mentioned earlier also move in, just so that they don't feel left out. These events are just a prelude for what will ultimately lead Yuki to discover her own "Wonderful Everyday" during this chapter.

                                <p>A game that we call "Kamige" (god's game) and it's no exaggeration. It is indeed a god-tier game. Yes, it is confusing and it is not for everyone. This game is philosophical but one thing it thought me was to live happily. Trigger Warning: This game consists of suicide, rape, bestiality, and disturbing scenes. If one were to give it a try and understood it's meaning, they'll remember it as god's game..</p>

His mother passed away in a car accident when he was young, leading his father, Naoyuki, to resort to alcohol and gambling to cope.
