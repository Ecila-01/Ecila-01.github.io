                <h1> LIGHT NOVELS </h1>
                <p> Light Novels (LN for short) are novels for the young audience. Unlike manga, light novels consist of mostly text with a few illustrations in between. Here are some of the light novels that I highly recommend.</p>

                                The protagonist Kiyotaka Ayanokōji is a student of D-class, which is where the school dumps its “inferior” students in order to ridicule them.

                                A country that only accepted magicians, a muscle loving giant, a youth at death’s door awaiting his lover’s return, a Princess left alone in the ruined country, and the story of the witch herself up until now and from now on.
                                <br><br>
                                While meeting particularly peculiar people and experiencing others’ moments of beauty, even now, the witch keeps spinning the tale of meeting and parting evermore.

                                The Republic of San Magnolia has long been under attack from the neighbouring Giadian Empire’s army of unmanned drones known as the Legion. After years of painstaking research, the Republic finally developed autonomous drones of their own, turning the one-sided struggle into a war without casualties-or at least, that’s what the government claims.
                                <br><br>
                                In truth, there is no such thing as a bloodless war. Beyond the fortified walls protecting the eighty-five Republic territories lies the “nonexistent” Eighty-Sixth Sector. The young men and women of this forsaken land are branded the Eighty-Six and, stripped of their humanity, pilot the “unmanned” weapons into battle…
                                <br><br>
                                Shin is the leader of a squadron of eighty-sixers. Lena is a “handler” who commands the detachment from the remote rear with the help of special communication technology.
                                <br><br>
                                The farewell story of the severe and sad struggle of these two begins!

                                He discovers that Hitagi weighs next to nothing, in defiance of physics. Despite being threatened by her, Koyomi offers his help, and introduces her to Meme Oshino, a middle-aged homeless man who helped him stop being a vampire.

                                <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                                <p>Is it wrong to face the perils of Dungeon alone, in a single-member guild blessed by a failed goddess? Maybe. Is it wrong to dream of playing hero to hapless maidens in Dungeon? Maybe not. After one misguided adventure, Bell quickly discovers that anything can happen in the labyrinth-even chance encounters with beautiful women. Only problem? He’s the one who winds up the damsel in distress!
